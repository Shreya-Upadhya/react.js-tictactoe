**Tic Tac Toe Game**

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe Game built with React.js and JavaScript! This is a simple and interactive version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players can take turns marking "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!

This project was developed using React.js for rendering the components and JavaScript for managing the state of the players, moves, and game status.

**Features**

***Player vs Player Mode***: Two players can take turns to play the game.
***Game Board***: A 3x3 grid where players place their marks.
State Management with JavaScript: The game uses JavaScript to manage the state of players, moves, and check for win conditions.
***Win Detection***: The game detects when a player wins by aligning three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.
***Restart Button***: A button to reset the game and start a new round.
Responsive Design: The game works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Technologies Used**

***React.js***: For building the dynamic user interface and rendering components.

***JavaScript***: For managing the state of players, moves, and game logic such as win detection and resetting the game.

***CSS***: For styling the game board, buttons, and layout.
